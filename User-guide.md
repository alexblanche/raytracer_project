## Syntax of the scene descriptor file <a name="syntax"></a>

The scene to render is defined in the file ```scene.txt```, with the following syntax.

### Initial parameters

The parameters should be proved in order, without comments.  

The resolution of the rendered image is defined by:  
``resolution width:1366 height:768``

The view angle of the camera is defined by the position of the camera in world space, the direction it points at, and a vector rightdir orthogonal to the direction and "to the right" (it is used to tilt the camera in any angle). The ``fov_width`` parameter designates the width of the screen in world space (used to zoom in or out of the scene). The associated parameter ``fov_height`` is defined automatically (for width/height aspect ratio). Finally, the ``distance`` parameter indicates the distance in world space between the screen and the camera.  
``camera position:(0, 0, 0) direction:(0, 0, 1) rightdir:(1, 0, 0) fov_width:1000 distance:400``  

To enable the depth of field camera effect, the focal distance and aperture can be specified with the commands:  
``focal_distance:500 aperture:100``  
on the same line as ``camera``.

The background color (the "sky") is defined by:  
``background_color 190 235 255``

Alternatively, one can define a background texture, which should be a 360 panoramic image, with the following syntax:  
``background_texture file_name.bmp rotate_x:3.14 rotate_y:0 rotate_z:0``  
The image is projected onto a sphere that surrounds the scene (at infinite distance) and rotated around the three axes by the specified angles (each between 0 and 2Ï€).  
The image must be a .bmp or .hdr file. For .hdr files, the gamma value can be defined by adding ``gamma:2.2`` after the ``rotate_z`` parameter.  

When polygon meshes are used (see below), the rendering can be accelerated with the [Bounding Volume Hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy) method. The polygons are placed in boxes, which are themselves recursively enclosed in larger boxes, until only one box remains. The ``polygons_per_bounding`` parameter designates the number of polygons in terminal nodes, and its optimal value for peak performance depends on the object.  
To enable the BVH strategy, a non-zero value should be specified:  
``polygons_per_bounding 3``

Specifying 0 will disable the method, and a linear search will be performed instead:  
``polygons_per_bounding 0``


### Material definition

Materials are defined by the following parameters:
- ``color``: the base color of the material. (it will be covered by the texture in the case of a textured polygon)
- ``emitted_color``: when the material emits some light, the color to be emitted
- ``reflectivity``: the reflectivity of the material. 0 for purely diffuse (matte) materials, 1 for pure mirrors, and a value between 0 and 1 for glossy materials (with blurry reflections)
- ``emission``: the brightness of the material. 0 for materials that do not emit light. The value can go above 1 and to an arbitrary value, but note that the material will appear closer to white (but will still cast a light of the given ``emitted_color``).
- ``specular_p``: represents how reflective the material is. A value of 0 will have the reflections on the material be purely diffuse (for matte objects). With 1, the material will specularly reflect the entirety of the incoming light (with glossiness subject to the ``reflectivity`` parameter). A value between 0 and 1 will be a mix of ``color`` and the reflection of the incoming light.
- ``reflects_color``: when the parameter ``specular_p`` is different from 0, the specular reflections will keep the ``color`` of the material. Usually ``reflects_color`` is set at ``false``, except in the case of conductors and metals.
- ``transparency``: the amount of light transmitted through the material when going at a normal angle, for transparent materials. The amount of light transmitted depends on the angle,, so even will a value of 1, some reflections will occur when the angle between the ray and the normal approaches $\pi$/2, according to Fresnel's formula.
- ``scattering``: the scattering of the light when transmitted through the material, similarly to ``reflectivity`` for reflections. The value should be close to 0 for most transparent materials.
- ``refraction_index``: the refraction index of the material, used when the ray is be refracted according to Snell-Descartes' law. Air has 1, water 1.33, glass 1.52, and diamond 2.42.  

Materials are thus defined with this syntax:  
``material:(color:(120, 120, 120) emitted_color:(0, 0, 0) reflectivity:1 emission:0 specular_p:1.0 reflects_color:false transparency:0 scattering:0 refraction_index:1)``  

A material can be given a name with this syntax:  
``material m1 (color:(...) ...)``

### Object definition

Objects can be defined in any order, with the following syntax.

- Sphere
A sphere is defined by its center and radius.  
``sphere center:(-500, 0, 600) radius:120 material:m1``

- Plane
A plane is defined by a normal vector and a point the plane goes through.  
``plane normal:(0, -1, 0) position:(0, 160, 0) material:m1``

- Box
A box is defined by its center, two axes x and y (the z axis is the cross product of x and y), and three lengths: the "length" along the x axis, the "height" along the y axis, and the "depth" along the z axis. The axes do not need to be unit vectors.    
``box center:(166, -200, 600) x_axis:(100, 100, -100) y_axis:(-200, 100, -100) 300 200 300 material:m1``

- Triangle
A triangle is defined by three points.  
``triangle (-620, -100, 600) (-520,100,500) (-540, -200, 700) material:m1``  

- Quad
A quad is defined by four points.  
``quad (-620, -100, 600) (-520, 100, 600) (-540, -200, 600) (-500, -250, 600) material:m1``

Triangles and quads are one-sided, and should be declared in counter-clockwise order. Behavior when looking through the back side is undefined.

- Cylinder
A cylinder is defined by its origin, direction vector, radius and length. The origin is the center of the bottom disk. The radius parameter designates the common radius of the bottom and top disks. The length is the length of the cylinder along the direction vector. The direction vector does not need to be a unit vector.    
``cylinder origin:(0, 0, 0) direction:(1, -1, 1) radius:100 length:300 material:m1``


### Texture definition
Triangles, quads, spheres and planes support texturing.  
Note that textures mapped on a quad warp when the shape of the quad is different from the quad's UV-coordinates in texture space (e.g. when the UV-coordinates describe a rectangle in texture space, but the quad is a trapezoid in world space).  

Textures must be loaded from a bmp file, and given a name:  
``load_texture t1 file_name.bmp``

Then when an object is defined, we can specify the texture mapping with this syntax:   
- Triangle
A triangle is textured with the specified UV-coordinates.  
``triangle (...) (...) (...) material:(...) texture:(t1 (0.2, 0.8) (0.5, 0.15) (0.7, 0.65))``   
- Quad
A quad is textured with the specified UV-coordinates.  
``quad (...) (...) (...) (...) material:(...) texture:(t1 (0.2, 0.8) (0.2, 0.15) (0.7, 0.15) (0.7, 0.8))``
- Sphere
For a sphere, the texture is oriented with the forward and right directions.  
``sphere center:(...) radius:... material:(...) texture:(t1 forward:(0,0,1) right:(-1,0,0))``
- Plane
For a plane, the texture is oriented and scaled with the right direction (the down direction is determined with the normal) and a scaling factor.  
``plane normal:(...) position:(...) material:(...) texture:(t1 right:(1,0,0) scale:100)``


### Normal map definition
Surfaces can be applied a normal map, read from a bmp file in OpenGL format.

The normal map is loaded with a syntax similar to textures:  
``load_normal_map n1 file_name.bmp``

Then it is applied to an object in the ``texture`` field by adding ``normal:n1`` (where ``n1`` is the normal map name) right after the texture name.  
E.g.: ``sphere center:(...) radius:... material:(...) texture:(t1 normal:n1 forward:(0,0,1) right:(-1,0,0))``



### Polygon mesh import
The project supports polygon meshes in .obj format. Associated .mtl files are supported, but materials can also be declared beforehand, with the same name as in the associated mtl file.  
An .obj file can be imported by specifying its file name, the texture mapped onto the object, a shifting vector and a scaling factor. The texture shall be declared beforehand and given a variable name.  
``````
material wood_mat (...)  // appearing in wooden_table.obj
material metal_mat (...) // appearing in wooden_table.obj
load_texture wood wood_texture.bmp
load_obj wooden_table.obj (texture:wood shift:(1,0,0) scale:2)
``````

Polygon meshes do not support normal mapping yet.

### Comments
A line can be commented by adding a ``#`` and a space at the beginning of the line:  
``# sphere [...]``




## Command line arguments <a name="command"></a>

The first command-line argument is always an integer, and specifies the maximum number of bounces allowed for each ray:  
``./main 10``  

The executable works in two modes: the interactive mode displays the image in a window every 10 samples per pixel, and the non-interactive mode generates a given number of samples per pixel without display.

### Interactive mode

The interactive mode is activated by default, with this syntax:  
``./main 10``  

The time taken to render each sample per pixel can be displayed with the option:   
``./main 10 -time``

When a single sample per pixel takes a long time, the progress and estimated time can be displayed with the option:  
``./main 10 -time all``

A window appears and the generated image is updated after each sample. The user can enter an input among the following:  
- B key: Save the generated image as ``output/image.bmp`` and continue
- R key: Save the generated raw data as ``output/image.rtdata`` and continue
- Esc key: Exit


### Non-interactive mode

To render in the non-interactive mode, the desired number of samples of pixels needs to be specified with this syntax:  
``./main 10 -rays 100``

The progress will be displayed and updated every 10 samples per pixel. The generated image is saved as ``output/image.bmp``. The directory ``output`` is created if it does not exist yet.


## Merger executable <a name="merger"></a>

The ``merge`` executable can be compiled with ```make merge```. It is used to merge several raw data files into one raw data file and a bmp file.
The syntax is the following:  
``./merge dest.bmp dest.rtdata source1.rtdata source2.rtdata ... sourcen.rtdata``  
When the source files are rtdata files ``source1.rtdata``, ..., ``sourcen.rtdata`` and the destination files are ``dest.bmp`` and ``dest.rtdata``.  
The gamma correction value can be specified with the command ``-gamma:2.2`` between ``dest.rtdata`` and ``source1.rtdata``.

## Postprocessing <a name="post"></a>

The postprocessing glow effect can be applied to raw data files with the ``postprocess`` executable, which can be compiled with ``make postprocess``. It generates an output bmp image. A threshold can be specified to only affect lights of a certain minimum brightness (the threshold cannot be lower than 4), and a glow intensity parameter can also be specified.
The syntax is the following:  
``./postprocess -threshold 10 -glow 3 source.rtdata dest.bmp``  
When the source file is ``source.rtdata`` and the destination file is ``dest.bmp``. The ``-threshold`` and ``-glow`` arguments are optional.
